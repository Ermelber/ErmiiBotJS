# ErmiiBotJS

A general purpose discord bot.

## Settings

Before doing anything you need to create a settings file called ``settings.json`` in the root of the bot:
```json
{
    "prefix" : ".",
    "token" : "your_token",
    "mcHostName": "mcHostName",
    "adminUserIds": ["admin_user_id_0","admin_user_id_1"],
    "description":"ErmiiBot, made by Ermelber"
}
```

## Setup

- Install nodejs and npm 
- Run ``npm i`` to install dependencies

Whenever you want to start the bot just run ``node .``

## Features

- Minecraft server status
- Sending pizza images (important)
- Uptime command to brag about server uptime
- Maybe more, who knows

Since this bot is nothing special you are free to fork it and do whatever you want with it.
